Banks also benificial that they make customers easier to know their loan status.

### Applications:  
**Financial Institutions:** Loan approval predictions enable banks and lenders to automate the loan decision process, enhancing efficiency and customer satisfaction by quickly determining applicants' creditworthiness.  

**Risk Management:** It assists in managing credit risk within financial portfolios, allowing institutions to balance risk and reward more effectively and to identify potential defaulters ahead of time.  

**Insurance:** Insurance companies use loan approval predictions for underwriting, to assess the risk of insuring individuals or businesses, thereby setting premiums more accurately according to potential risk.  

**Government and Regulatory Agencies:** These models help in formulating financial regulations and policies by analyzing lending trends, and they ensure compliance with fair lending laws, aiming to protect consumers from discriminatory practices.  
### Compiler Type:  
I used a compiler CPU provided in google colab while running this project.
